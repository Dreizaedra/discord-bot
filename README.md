# Discord Bot

### Disclaimer :
This is my first time ever coding something in Python, so this probably isn't 'great' by any means. I am currently in formation to learn Web Dev stuff, primarily PHP and JS, but I'm also interested in learning other langages, so here I am ! 

Anyway I'm far more experienced in PHP (with and without Symfony) through my co-op formation and I'm trying to learn a new langage by coding this, if only for myself !

### What is this ?
This is a discord bot entirely done in Python that I'm trying to build from the ground up. I did find some templates on git and the like, but I decided not to use them yet as I didn't understand much of what was going on in those.

### What purpose does this so-called Bot serve ?
I'm coding some relatively random functions into it, here's a list as of 22-02-2024 :
- [] Hangman (English) - 80%
